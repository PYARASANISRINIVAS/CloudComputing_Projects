Description : 

    Database service is the one of the important service in every industry that may be relational data or the non relational data they store . As we are making our works to be digitalized the storing of the data becoming more important.for every collage,company or any store etc.. it is  very important to secure and also to manage the data in an meaning full way.

    AWS Databases is the another important service of the aws resources along with compute,network and storage services.

    In this project we are making the use of the aws resources for storing our relational data. we are using the MYSQL Database which is popular for easy storing and retrieving the data with the help of the simple query.

    Their are two ways to utilize the aws resources for databases:
    1. Creating an Amazon EC2( Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ) service  and installing MYSQL manually on the EC2 OS.
    2. Making use of the Amazon RDS ( Amazon Relational Database service ) which is dedicated particularly to the Relational Data . 

    We are utilizing the 1st method i.e using EC2 and installing the MYSQL manually on it.

Software Requirements:

    - Launching an AWS EC2 with windows/linux distribution os.
    - Need to install mysql server on the os.
    
conclusion 
    - we can directly use the mysql using the terminal with the help of the command. (sudo mysql)
    - Now we are storing the data in the instance directly
