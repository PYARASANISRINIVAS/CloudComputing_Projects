        - The above is the scripting format which need to be mentioned in every script then only the the linux interpreter will know what is the type of the shell you have to execute it.

    can we run the shell script directly?
        - No , we can't directly run the file because by default permission of the execution was not given so we need to give the permission when we execute in the below format.

        - ./<filename>
        
        How to change the permission?
            - chmod u+x <filename>
    
    Another way to execute the code is.
        - bash <filename>
